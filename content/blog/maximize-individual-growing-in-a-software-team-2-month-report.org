#+TITLE: Maximize individual growing in a software team


Couple months ago we started an
[[https://channikhabra.github.io/blog/how-to-maximize-individual-growth-in-a-software-team/][initiative]]
in our team here at [[http://trantorinc.com/][Trantor]] with the focus
on nurturing a culture which optimizes personal growth of an individual
in the team. I believe it is turning out to be quite successful. We
decided we'll focus on 4 things to achieve our goal:

** Interactive sessions of tools/technologies
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: interactive-sessions-of-tools-technologies
   :END:
This is where we've observed most success. We have had 4 sessions in
past 2 months (we do two-week sprints), with following primary topics:

- Up your ops game: Ansible and Vagrant /(delivered by *Charanjit Singh
  (me)*)/
- Up your ops game: Docker and Docker Compose /(delivered by *Charanjit
  Singh (me)*/
- Quick and Dirty Kafka /(collaboratively delivered by *Charanjit Singh
  (me), Rupinder Singh, Sheenam Narula, Krishan Saini*)/
- Getting acquainted with Elasticsearch /(delivered by *Krishan Saini*)/

** Collaboratively studying open source projects we use
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: collaboratively-studying-open-source-projects-we-use
   :END:
We started off with =chai.js=, but after probably spending only a few
minutes each, the
[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13dko42FS9kcnpqnrjp9QCouQO0vZHDQ0tslID3BAQBs/edit?usp=sharing][google
doc]] we created for collaboratively creating notes didn't see much
action.

** Being active in Trantor forums
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: being-active-in-trantor-forums
   :END:
Plan was to use Trantor Forums as a platform for proposing
(revolutionary) changes in our project. We started off with
[[https://forum.trantorinc.com/t/suggested-improvements-for-tdd-in-veriown-cloud-mutation-testing-and-running-tests-concurrently/74][a
proposal to introduce mutation testing]] in our test-coverage reports,
but didn't move forward from that.

I believe this is because we don't really spend as much time exploring
new/different things/subject-matters to be able to bring more of such
proposals. This problem is one of many that should fix itself if we are
successful in fostering a culture of self growth in the team.

** Day long hackathons
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: day-long-hackathons
   :END:
We are yet to realize this dream. Shiva proposed a neat little idea to
solve a problem faced by Trantor employees, but turned out an official
solution was already in the works and about to be released in couple
weeks (it didn't). I believe we should have just gone ahead and spend a
day to build what we wanted, just for the heck of it. That would have
been more fruitful.

--------------

Above points are more than just steps to achieve our goal, I believe,
they are also metrics of our success. How much engagement each of these
get reflects on how much of a self-growth culture is prospering in the
team. I wonder if we can somehow quantize these per-person. If nothing
else, that'll create some cool graphs to gawk at.
