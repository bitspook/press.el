I gave this talk in one of internal sessions at Trantor. Goal was to
acquaint one of our software teams into the world of application
security. This was a basic talk, just to familiarize attendees with
basic information security concepts. I leveraged this opportunity to
propose setting up a Red Team in Trantor.

As practical part of this session, I created a docker based virtual lab
with webgoat set up. During the session we went through some of the
exercises, rest were left for the attendees as homework. Here's the
=docker-compose.yml= file that was used in the session.

#+begin_example
  version: '3'
  services:
    webgoat:
      image: webgoat/webgoat-8.0
      environment:
        - WEBWOLF_HOST=webwolf
        - WEBWOLF_PORT=9090
      ports:
        - "8080:8080"
        - "9001:9001"
      volumes:
        - ./docker-volumes/webgoat-home:/home/webgoat/.webgoat
    webwolf:
      image: webgoat/webwolf
      ports:
        - "9090:9090"
      command: --spring.datasource.url=jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://webgoat:9001/webgoat --server.address=0.0.0.0
#+end_example

To start the lab, simply create a directory, save above snippet as
=docker-compose.yml=, and run =docker-compose up= in it. You will then
be able to access webgoat on http://localhost:8080/WebGoat
