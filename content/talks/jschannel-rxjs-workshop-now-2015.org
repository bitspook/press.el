I was very fascinated about Reactive programming, and when we had a shortage of
talks in [[https://www.meetup.com/jslovers-bengaluru/][JsChannel]], I decided to give a workshop on RxJS.

The [[https://github.com/bitspook/rxjs-workshop-nov-2015][code used in this workshop]] can be found in my Github.
